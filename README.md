**IMPORTANT:** 

Y and Z are somehow inverted on my Keyboard, so if pressing Y for you doesn't result in rotating around the Y-Axis switch the angles 
in void key_callback back.

## Press the following keys to:

1. **Rotate around the Axes:**
     * X
     * Y
     * Z
  
2. **Zoom:**
     * W: zoom in
     * S: zoom out
  
3. **Select the joints:**
     * UP
     * DOWN
  
4. **Move the joints:**
     * LEFT
     * RIGHT
